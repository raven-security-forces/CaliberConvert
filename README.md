# RSF CFG
RSF CFG is a bundle of various Game Modifications custom-made to improve Gameplay for the RSF Arma 3 Unit.

## AdvUrbanRappelAceCompat
Short name long rope. Fixes Urban Rappelling issues since the ACE CSW update. Other Versions are available in my Workshop.

## Caliber-Conversion
My masterpiece, replacing Calibers of all Vanilla Weapons where applicable with their real-life counterpart.

The ACR (“MX”) now fires 5.56x45.
There now is an AK-12. The AK-12 ingame fires 7.62x39, which is actually fired by the AK-15, while the real-life AK-12 fires 5.45x39. You get both.
The KH-2002 (“Katiba”) now fires 5.56x45 and features a 3 Round Burst.
The MG5 ( “Navid”) now fires 7.62x51.
The MSBS Grot B (“Promet”) now fires 5.56x45 and features a 3 Round Burst.
The QBU-88 (“CMR-76”) now fires 5.8x42mm
The RFB (“SDAR”) now fires 7.62x51.
The Stoner-99 (“Mk 200”) now fires 5.56x45
SVDK Magpul ("Cyrus") had it's name changed to better reflect it's real-life counterpart.

All Rifles have had their Mass adjusted accordingly and are compatible with Vanilla Units, Missions and all common Weapon Mods in regards to attachments, with a few minor exceptions. (See 1.0 Patchnotes)

## Gear-Rebalance
With great firepower, comes standardization of Uniforms.

CSAT is now no longer the best Faction, although it will remain so in my heart.
All Vanilla Uniforms (and the Special Purpose Helmet) have had their Load, Mass, Ballistic Protection and Explosive Resistance adjusted and Balanced among Factions.
Vanilla Loadouts have been take into consideration, so there shouldn’t be any clashes.
Let me know if there are.

## GRAD-Trenches-RSF
A simple Compatibility Mod that allows us to use GRAD Trenches on previously unsupported Terrains. Remind me to make a Pull Request.

## RSF-Cutscene
Shows a custom, RSF-themed Main Menu backgound Mission.
